# Hot Key
There is an optional hot key, must be enabled in the MCM.  It supports: 
- ability to start a sexual act with an NPC in the crosshairs or between NPCs not in the crosshairs.
- ability to dress/undress the actor under the across hairs.
- If the NPC in the crosshair or player is in a sexlab animation 
  - change the style of sex 
  - add a per-stage description 
  - add a orgasm denied for parcipate in the sex 

## Per Stage Description 
When you press the hot key on an actor in sex, one of two thing will happen:
- If the animation's stage already has a description, the description will be presented with the option to replace it. If you choose to edit, it will be the same as the next step
- If the animation's stage does not have a description, a text field will be presented to add it. 
  - After you finish typing, the code will add the actor's names and present the final description to you.  You can accept or reject. If it is empty you most likely used the wrong variable names.

Descriptions you create will be stored in `SkyrimNet_SexLab/animations/\_local\_`with a single file for each animation. Additional stage descriptions will be stored in `animations/(author_name)` as they are shared with me, or people can simple give them to you.  The author's name will be presented when the description is provided, so you know where to edit the files. You can always create new description in \_local\_.

- Once the file exists, you can edit with your favorite text editor if you so choose.
- If no stage descriptions is used, the tag based description will be used. 
- The last stage with a description will be used if none is found.
- descriptions will be used in the order the directories are read, with \_local\_ loaded last.

- We now support inja format for stage descriptions:
  - There will be an array of actors.  If there is a victum, it is normally the first character.
  - If you aren't sure.  Type just the actors needs so you can see which is which.
  - {{sl.actors.0}} is the first actor 
  - {{sl.actors.1}} is the second, etc 
  - {{sl.actors.2}} is the third, etc 

## Orgasm Denied 
Some animation do not provide a justification for all actors getting a chance to orgasm.
It is stored as an array of integers matching the position of the actors in the thread. 
- 0: the actor is allowed an orgasm
- 1: the actor is denied an orgrasm 

## Sex Style 
If you have enabled the Tag Editor, you will be presented with the ability to set the style,
This will change how the sex is presented to the LLM:
- Forcefully fucking
- having sex
- gently making love

## Examples 
Examples can be found in the animations/GoodProvider sub directory.

    "stage 1": {
        "description":"{{sl.actors.1}} kisses {{sl.actors.0}}.",
